 <p>As long as you are in the tag html does not care about spacing. This means even if you put extra spaces in a sentence the                              html or your browser will take it as a normal sentence. It will not care about the extra spaces. It takes care of it as it believe you made an accident. You can                inspect this page and see how many expra spaces I added and it still comes clean on the browser. The reason for this is Html is white space collapsing. </p>

 <p> Each tag is also separated autoatically as you can see here.</p>
 <p> To add a space you have to use a special tag it is called "br>" this tag means break. This is one of those special tags that do not have to be closed also as you will learn more html you will see that there are certain tags that do not require closure. Now let's try to use this tage. Please see below. </p>
