<p>As you can see the ordered list has numbers and the unordered list does not. These lists are very important in HTML as you progress you will have to make these look beautiful. These are used for putting menu on the website. For example. Home, Menu, Tasks. You normally see these at the top of the pages.Each list has it's own difference as you can see above.</p>
